# TripPlanner ✈️

> **Built with AI Vibecoding** ✨  
> A premium, cinematic travel planning interface designed to inspire and organize your next adventure.

## 🌟 About

TripPlanner is a modern SaaS landing page and interactive prototype for a travel itinerary application. It features a dark, glassmorphism-heavy aesthetic ("Vibecoding") that prioritizes visual impact and smooth user experience.

This project was built entirely using **React + Vite** and **Plain CSS** (no external UI libraries), focusing on clean code and premium animations.

## 🚀 How It Works

The application guides users through a seamless planning journey:

1.  **Inspiration**: Starts with a cinematic video hero section to set the mood.
2.  **Education**: "How it Works" and "Why TripPlanner" sections explain the value proposition.
3.  **Transport**: Users select their preferred mode of travel (Flight, Train, Car).
4.  **Accommodation**: A visual selector for hotels/resorts with glassmorphism cards.
5.  **Itinerary Builder**: A day-by-day interactive timeline to plan activities.
6.  **Budgeting**: A smart, sticky budget panel that tracks estimated costs in real-time.
7.  **Insights**: "Best Time to Travel" visualization helps pick the perfect dates.
8.  **Finalize**: Detailed route map and shareable summary options.
